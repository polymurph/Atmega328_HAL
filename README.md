# Atmega328_HAL

Use this library to easily configure the Atmega32/P/PB devices onboard peripherals such as SPI,
Timers, etc. The emphasis of this library is to enable fast and efficiant peripheral 
configuration with minimal effort. This takes over the bitgrinding workload of configuring the peripherals on register level. This allows you to use your time more efficiently for the actual work.
